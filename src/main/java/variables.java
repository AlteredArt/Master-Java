In Java, we specify the type of information we’re storing. 
Primitive datatypes are types of data built-in to the 
Java system. The three main primitive types we’ll cover 
are int, double, and boolean; this lesson will introduce 
these built-in types and more.

// datatype variableName
int age;
double salaryRequirement;
boolean isEmployed;

For example, to assign 2011 to a variable named yearCodecademyWasFounded of type int, we write:

int yearCodecademyWasFounded = 2011;
