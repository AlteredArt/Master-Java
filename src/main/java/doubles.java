// The double primitive data type can help. double can hold 
// decimals as well as very large and very small numbers. 
// The maximum value is 1.797,693,134,862,315,7 E+308, which 
// is approximately 17 followed by 307 zeros. The minimum 
// value is 4.9 E-324, which is 324 decimal places!

// doubles can have decimal places:
double price = 8.99;
// doubles can have values bigger than what an int could hold:
double gdp = 12237700000;
