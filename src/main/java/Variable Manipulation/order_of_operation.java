// Order of Operations

// If we were to place multiple operators in a single expression, what operation 
// would the compiler evaluate first?

// int num = 5 * (10 - 4) + 4 / 2;
// The order of operations dictates the order in which an expression (like the one 
// above) is evaluated. Operators that share the same precedence are evaluated from 
// Left-to-Right within the expression.

// The order is as follows:

// Parentheses
// Exponents
// Modulo/Multiplication/Division
// Addition/Subtraction
// With this new information in mind, letâ€™s dissect the expression from above so 
// that we can find the value of num:

// 5 * (10 - 4) + 4 / 2
// 10 - 4 would be evaluated first because it is wrapped in parentheses. This value 
// would become 6 making our expression look like this:

// 5 * 6 + 4 / 2 
// Next, 5 * 6 will be evaluated because of the * operator. This value is 30. Our 
// expression now looks like this:

// 30 + 4 / 2
// Following the order of operations, 4 / 2 will be evaluated next because the 
// division operator / has higher precedence than the addition operator +. Our 
// expression now resembles the following:

// 30 + 2
// 30 + 2 is 32. This means that the value of num is 32.

public class Operations {
	public static void main(String[] args) { 

    int expression1 = 5 % 2 - (4 * 2 - 1);
    System.out.println(expression1);

    int expression2 = (3 + (2 * 2 - 5)) + 6 - 5;
    System.out.println(expression2);

    int expression3 = 5 * 4 % 3 - 2 + 1;
    System.out.println(expression3);

	}
}


// Output:
// -6
// 3
// 1
