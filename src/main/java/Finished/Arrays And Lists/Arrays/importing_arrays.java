Importing Arrays

When we printed out the array we created in the last exercise, we saw a memory address that did not help us understand what was contained in the array.

If we want to have a more descriptive printout of the array itself, we need a toString() method that is provided by the Arrays package in Java.

import java.util.Arrays;

We put this at the top of the file, before we even define the class!

When we import a package in Java, we are making all of the methods of that package available in our code.

The Arrays package has many useful methods, including Arrays.toString(). When we pass an array into Arrays.toString(), we can see the contents of the array printed out:

import java.util.Arrays;
 
public class Lottery(){
 
  public static void main(String[] args){
    int[] lotteryNumbers = {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};
    String betterPrintout = Arrays.toString(lotteryNumbers);
    System.out.println(betterPrintout);
  }
 
}

This code will print:

[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]




// import the Arrays package here:
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Newsfeed {
  
  
  public Newsfeed(){
    
  }
    
  public String[] getTopics(){
    String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
    return topics;
  }
  

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(topics));
  }
}


Output-only Terminal
Output:

[Ljava.lang.String;@2aae9190
[Opinion, Tech, Science, Health]
