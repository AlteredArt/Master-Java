// Get Element By Index
// Now that we have an array declared and initialized, we want to 
// be able to get values out of it.

// We use square brackets, [ and ], to access data at a certain index:

// double[] prices = {13.1, 15.87, 14.22, 16.66};
 
// System.out.println(prices[1]);
// This command would print:

// 15.87
// This happens because 15.87 is the item at the 1 index of the array. 
// Remember, the index of an array starts at 0 and ends at an index 
// of one less than the number of elements in the array.

// If we try to access an element outside of its appropriate index 
// range, we will receive an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException error.

// For example, if we were to run the command System.out.println(prices[5]), 
// weâ€™d get the following output:

// java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 5
