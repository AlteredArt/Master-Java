Introduction to Conditional Operators

Java includes operators that only use boolean values. These conditional operators help simplify expressions containing complex boolean relationships by reducing multiple boolean values to a single value: true or false.

For example, what if we want to run a code block only if multiple conditions are true. We could use the AND operator: &&.

Or, we want to run a code block if at least one of two conditions are true. We could use the OR operator: ||.

Finally, we can produce the opposite value, where true becomes false and false becomes true, with the NOT operator: !.

Understanding these complex relationships can feel overwhelming at first. Luckily, truth tables, like the ones seen to the right, can assist us in determining the relationship between two boolean-based conditions.

In this lesson, weâ€™ll explore each of these conditional operators to see how they can be implemented into our conditional statements.



public class Reservation {
    int guestCount;
    int restaurantCapacity;
    boolean isRestaurantOpen;
    boolean isConfirmed;
    
    public Reservation(int count, int capacity, boolean open) {
      if (count < 1 || count > 8) {
        System.out.println("Invalid reservation!");
      }
      guestCount = count;
          restaurantCapacity = capacity;
          isRestaurantOpen = open;
    }  
    
    public void confirmReservation() {
      if (restaurantCapacity >= guestCount && isRestaurantOpen) {
        System.out.println("Reservation confirmed");
        isConfirmed = true;
      } else {
        System.out.println("Reservation denied");
              isConfirmed = false;
      }
    }
    
    public void informUser() {
      if (!isConfirmed) {
        System.out.println("Unable to confirm reservation, please contact restaurant.");
      } else {
        System.out.println("Please enjoy your meal!");
      }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Reservation partyOfThree = new Reservation(3, 12, true);
      Reservation partyOfFour = new Reservation(4, 3, true);
      partyOfThree.confirmReservation();
      partyOfThree.informUser();
      partyOfFour.confirmReservation();
      partyOfFour.informUser();
    }
  }




  Reservation confirmed
Please enjoy your meal!
Reservation denied
Unable to confirm reservation, please contact restaurant.
