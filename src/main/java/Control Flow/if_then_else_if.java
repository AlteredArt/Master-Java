If-Then-Else-If
The conditional structure we’ve learned can be chained together to check as many conditions as are required by our program.

Imagine our program is now selecting the appropriate course for a student. We’ll check their submission to find the correct course enrollment.

The conditional statement now has multiple conditions that are evaluated from the top down:

String course = "Theatre";
 
if (course.equals("Biology")) {
 
  // Enroll in Biology course
 
} else if (course.equals("Algebra")) {
 
  // Enroll in Algebra course
 
} else if (course.equals("Theatre")) {
 
  // Enroll in Theatre course
 
} else {
 
  System.out.println("Course not found!");
 
}
The first condition to evaluate to true will have that code block run. Here’s an example demonstrating the order:

int testScore = 72;
 
if (testScore >= 90) {
 
  System.out.println("A");
 
} else if (testScore >= 80) {
 
  System.out.println("B");
 
} else if (testScore >= 70) {
 
  System.out.println("C");
 
} else if (testScore >= 60) {
 
  System.out.println("D");
 
} else {
 
  System.out.println("F");
 
}
// prints: C
This chained conditional statement has two conditions that evaluate true. Because testScore >= 70 comes before testScore >= 60, only the earlier code block is run.

Note: Only one of the code blocks will run.

Instructions
1.
We need to calculate the shipping costs for our orders.

There’s a new instance field, String shipping, that we use to calculate the cost.

Use a chained if-then-else to check for different values within the calculateShipping() method.

When the shipping instance field equals "Regular", the method should return 0.

When the shipping instance field equals "Express", the method should return 1.75.

Else the method should return .50.


public class Order {
  boolean isFilled;
  double billAmount;
  String shipping;
  
  public Order(boolean filled, double cost, String shippingMethod) {
		if (cost > 24.00) {
      System.out.println("High value item!");
    }
    isFilled = filled;
    billAmount = cost;
    shipping = shippingMethod;
  }
  
  public void ship() {
    if (isFilled) {
      System.out.println("Shipping");
      System.out.println("Shipping cost: " + calculateShipping());
    } else {
      System.out.println("Order not ready");
    }
  }
  
  public double calculateShipping() {
	 	// declare conditional statement here
    if(shipping == "Regular"){
      return 0;
    } else if(shipping == "Express"){
      return 1.75;
    } else {
      return .50;
    }
 	}
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // do not alter the main method!
    Order book = new Order(true, 9.99, "Express");
    Order chemistrySet = new Order(false, 72.50, "Regular");
    
    book.ship();
    chemistrySet.ship();
  }
}



Output:
High value item!
Shipping
Shipping cost: 1.75
Order not ready
